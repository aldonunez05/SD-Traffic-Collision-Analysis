# 🚦 San Diego Traffic Collision Severity Prediction

This project uses machine learning to analyze traffic collision data from San Diego and predict the severity of crashes — including whether they result in fatalities, injuries, or no harm. It also identifies key risk factors like time of day, location (police beat), and date.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict crash severity (`fatal`, `injury`, `none`) from traffic report data
- **Tech**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, imbalanced-learn
- **Data**: Official San Diego traffic collision dataset (2015+)

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world traffic data
- Balanced imbalanced classes using SMOTE
- Trained and evaluated a Random Forest classifier
- Identified most important features using feature importances and SHAP
- Achieved ~95% accuracy on balanced validation, and ~81% accuracy on real-world distribution

---

## 🧠 Insights

- **Police beat**, **hour**, and **month** are the top predictors of severity
- The model performs well at identifying high-risk collisions
- Potential to integrate into a real-time crash risk dashboard

## 📈 Example Results
| Class   | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Fatal   | 1.00      | 0.73   | 0.84     |
| Injury  | 0.87      | 0.71   | 0.78     |
| None    | 0.68      | 0.99   | 0.81     |
